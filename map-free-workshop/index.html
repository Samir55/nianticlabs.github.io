    <p>
        The Map-free Visual Relocalization workshop investigates topics related to metric visual relocalization relative to a single reference image instead of relative to a map.
        This problem is of major importance to many higher level applications, such as Augmented/Mixed Reality, SLAM and 3D reconstruction.
        It is important now, because both industry and academia are debating whether and how to build HD-maps of the world for those tasks. Our community is working to reduce the need for such maps in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>    
        We host the first Map-free Visual Relocalization Challenge 2024 competition with two tracks: map-free metric relative pose from a single image to a single image (proposed by Arnold et al. in ECCV 2022) 
        and from a query sequence to a single image (new).
        While the former is a more challenging and thus interesting research topic, 
        the latter represents a more realistic relocalization scenario, where the system making the queries may fuse information from query images and tracking poses over a short amount of time and baseline.    
        We invite papers to be submitted to the workshop.

                Torsten Sattle is a Senior Researcher at CTU Prague.
    Before, he was a tenured associate professor at Chalmers University of Technology.
    He received a PhD in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, in 2014.
    He was a post-doctoral and senior researcher at ETH Zurich Dec. '13 - Dec. '18.
    Torsten has worked on feature-based localization methods (PAMI’17), 
    long-term localization (CVPR’18, '21, ICCV’19, ECCV’20), 
    localization on mobile devices (ECCV’14, IJRR’20), 
    and using semantic scene understanding for localization (CVPR’18, ECCV’18, ICCV’19). 
    Torsten has co-organized tutorials and workshops at CVPR, ECCV, and ICCV, and was / is an area chair for CVPR, ICCV, 3DV, GCPR, ICRA, and ECCV. 
    He was a general chair for 3DV’22, and a program chair for DAGM GCPR’20 and ECCV’24.

            <p class="speaker-bio"> Simon Lynen is a tech lead manager at Google Zurich.
                His group focuses on providing high precision mobile-phone localization as part of the Visual Positioning Service (VPS). Devices with Google’s augmented reality capabilities can leverage VPS to enable global scale location-aware experiences such as ARCore CloudAnchors and GoogleMaps LiveView. Simon earned a doctorate at the Autonomous Systems Lab at ETH Zurich with a focus on visual navigation and localization algorithms for robotics, mobile devices, and autonomous cars. As visiting researcher, Simon contributed central pieces to core algorithms of Google’s ARCore. In talks at TEDx Zurich, ThinkingDigital, Zurich Minds, and scientific conferences, Simon has provided a behind-the-scenes view of the ARCore technology and its latest capabilities.</p>

            In 2016 Jakob Engel joined the Surreal Vision team at Oculus Research in Redmond, working on the future of 3D-enabled Machine Perception.
            He did their Bachelor and Master at TU Munich (2009 and 2012), followed up with a PhD at the Computer Vision Group there, headed by Professor Daniel Cremers. He spent 6 months as Intern at Intel Research with Vladlen Koltun, was a google PhD fellow, and worked with SIEMENS within the Software Campus Initiative. His PhD was about direct visual SLAM, 3D reconstruction, sensor fusion and some cool flying quadrocopter stuff - mostly he developed LSD-SLAM and DSO.
